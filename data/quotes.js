	quote: "Then, even if one thousand people would say that it is useless--that it does not make sense to practice mindful breathing--you would still smile. Because you know from your own experience that mindful breathing helps you to be fresh, to be peaceful, to be happy. So the opinions of other people cannot make you abandon your conviction, your belief. ~ Thích Nhất Hạnh"
}, {
	quote: "You know that the notion of beauty differs with every person. Something can be very beautiful to someone but not beautiful to other people. The notions of beauty or ugliness--they are just notions--and you are not affected by their opinions. ~ Thích Nhất Hạnh"
}, {
	quote: "You are a flower in the garden of humanity. You are not something less than a flower. ~ Thích Nhất Hạnh"
}, {
	quote: "Millions of people misunderstood us and yet we still continued with our path, because we had belief in our values. I think if you continue to practice like that, you will be solid as a mountain. You will not be assaulted by any kind of opinions. ~ Thích Nhất Hạnh"
}, {
	quote: "People who are happy use themselves for internal evaluation. It's not that they don't notice upward comparisons, but they don't let that affect their self-esteem, and they stay focused on their own improvement. A happy runner compares himself to his last run, not to others who are faster. ~ Sonja Lyubormirsky"
}, {
	quote: "Recognise that comparing yourself is a habit you have developed over your lifetime, and it isn't your fult. When we identify something as a habit and are honest about its impact on our self-esteem and mental health, we are in a much better position to change it. Start by noting down how many times you compare yourself throughout the day; you may be surprised at the number. ~ Psychology Today"
}, {
	quote: "Do you know why you compare yourself to others (apart from growing up in a society and culture that invites it)? We compare ourselves to others for many reasons, and knowing your reason will be helpful when managing it. Each time you compare yourself to someone else, note what the comparison was (e.g. lifestyle, body image, career or study, appearance, etc). Over time, you will see a theme that will help you identify why social comparison is habitual for you. ~ Psychology Today"
}, {
	quote: "Comparing yourself to others is an automatic habit. You probably don't realize you are doing it. Thus, one way to break the comparison habit is to bring awareness every time you do it: 'Ah, here is an unhelpful comparison thought!' ~ Psychology Today"
}, {
	quote: "Once you know when and why you are comparing, you can choose what you do with it. You can either take it on board, believe it to be true, or not. After all, it is just a thought like any other, and we can choose what thoughts we buy into based on whether they are helpful to us and help us move toward the life we want to live. ~ Psychology Today"
}, {
	quote: "It makes you consider shoes you don't like, but when that shoe doesn't fit, wear what you will, despite how they feel, comparison kills. The grass was fine, until it looked greener on the other side, now you're believing that you fell behind. But why try to match what should be one of a kind, you're one of a kind. ~ Jonathan McReynolds"

const impostorSyndromeQuotes = [{
	quote: "Faced with responsibility or prestige, we quickly become convinced that we are simply impostors, like an actor in the role of a pilot, wearing the uniform and making sunny cabin announcements while incapable of even starting the engines. It can feel easier simply not to try. ~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: "The root cause of the impostor syndrome is a hugely unhelpful picture of what other people are really like. We feel like impostors not because we are uniquely flawed, but because we fail to imagine how deeply flawed everyone else must necessarily also be beneath a more or less polished surface. ~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: "We know ourselves from the inside, but others only from the outside. We're constantly aware of all our anxieties, doubts and idiocies from within. Yet all we know of others is what they happen to do and tell us, a far narrower, and more edited source of information. ~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: "The solution to the impostor syndrome lies in making a crucial leap of faith, the leap that others' minds work in basically much the same ways as ours do. ~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: "Everyone must be as anxious, uncertain and wayward as we are. ~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: "It's a leap of faith because we just have to accept that the majority of what we feel and are, especially the more shameful, unmentionable sides, will have a corollary in each and every one of us. ~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: 'Making a leap of faith around what other people are really like helps us to humanize the world. ~ School of Life'
}, {
	quote: "It means that whenever we encounter a stranger we're not really encountering a stranger, we're in fact encountering someone who is - in spite of the surface evidence to the contrary - in basic ways very much like us - and that therefore nothing fundamental stands between us and the possibility of responsibility, success and fulfillment. ~ School of Life"

const acceptanceQuotes = [{
	quote: "If we can accept ourselves, seeing who we really are, it will be easy for us to accept other people and see who they really are. But if we cannot accept ourselves, we will not be able to accept other people. ~ Thích Nhất Hạnh"
}, {
	quote: "We need to realize that we all are streams of continuation, made up of both weaknesses and talents passed on to us by our blood ancestors. When we know this we can practice acceptance wholeheartedly. We tend to get angry at ourselves for our shortcomings but by practicing mindfulness, we are able to develop our talents and learn ways to gradually transform our weaknesses. ~ Thích Nhất Hạnh"
}, {
	quote: "We have to learn to accept all the positives and negatives in that stream of continuum. Like a river which has its water coming from many creeks and waterways. Sometimes we see as the river flows, one side is clear water, and another side, muddy water. We have to accept both. Because the streamlets that enter the river are like that, the river will be like that. We accept. We accept both the good and bad in the stream. ~ Thích Nhất Hạnh"
}, {
	quote: "'Dear brother, I accept you as you are. Dear sister, I accept you as you are.' And when we look at them this way, it's the eyes of understanding and compassion. Because understanding is compassion. If we can look at someone with the eyes of acceptance, the other person will suffer much less. ~ Thích Nhất Hạnh"
}, {
	quote: "Radical acceptance is the willingness to experience ourselves and our life as it is. ~ Tara Brach"
}, {
	quote: "Pain is not wrong. Reacting to pain as wrong initiates the trance of unworthiness. The moment we believe something is wrong, our world shrinks and we lose ourselves in the effort to combat the pain. ~ Tara Brach"
}, {
	quote: "We are uncomfortable because everything in our life keeps changing -- our inner moods, our bodies, our work, the people we love, the world we live in. We can't hold on to anything -- a beautiful sunset, a sweet taste, an intimate moment with a lover, our very existence as the body/mind we call self -- because all things come and go.  ~ Tara Brach"
}, {
	quote: "Imperfection is not our personal problem - it is a natural part of existing. ~ Tara Brach"

	quote: "What would it be like if I could accept life--accept this moment--exactly as it is? ~ Tara Brach"

	quote: "There is something wonderfully bold and liberating about saying yes to our entire imperfect and messy life. ~ Tara Brach"

const selfLoveQuotes = [{
	quote: "With one exception, no animal is capable of hating itself. That exception, of course, is human beings. It's one of the strangest, and most regrettable, flaws in our condition. This tendency to self-hatred is not only destructive of our spirit; it constantly undermines our efforts to establish workable relationships. It is logically impossible to allow anyone else to love us insofar as we remain obsessed by the thought of our own loathsome natures. ~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: "We can with kindness and good humor accept that being silly is entirely normal; wasting opportunities is universal. ~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: "Self-love shouldn't be predicated on the competitive idea that we must pull off extraordinary feats of courage or intelligence. True love is only ever the compassion of the fallen for the fallen; it's the search by one radically imperfect being to express their tenderness at the sight of the struggles and pains of another. ~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: "Somewhere in our minds, removed from the day to day, there sits a judge. They watch what we do, study how we perform, examine the effect we have on others, track our successes and failures - and then, eventually, they pass a verdict. So consequential is this judgment, it colors our entire sense of ourselves. The judge is in charge of what we call our self-esteem. ~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: "We can catch the sound of what our inner voice is like when we prompt ourselves to finish certain sentences: 'when I do something stupid, I usually tell myself'…~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: "Part of improving how we judge ourselves involves learning - in a conscious, deliberate way - to speak to ourselves in a new and different way - which means exposing ourselves to better voices. We need to hear constructive, kindly voices often enough and around tricky enough issues that they come to feel like normal and natural responses - so that, eventually, they become our own thoughts. ~ School of Life"
}, {
	quote: "Not every story has a happy ending, ... but the discoveries of science, the teachings of the heart, and the revelations of the soul all assure us that no human being is ever beyond redemption. The possibility of renewal exists so long as life exists. How to support that possibility in others and in ourselves is the ultimate question. ~ Dr. Gabor Maté"
}, {
	quote: "When I am sharply judgmental of any other person, it's because I sense or see reflected in them some aspect of myself that I don't want to acknowledge.~ Dr. Gabor Maté"

	quote: "The research literature has identified three factors that universally lead to stress: uncertainty, the lack of information and the loss of control. ~ Dr. Gabor Maté"

  quote: "She let go. She let go. Without a thought or a word, she let go. She let go of the fear. She let go of the judgments. She let go of the confluence of opinions swarming around her head. She let go of the committee of indecision within her. She let go of all the 'right' reasons. Wholly and completely, without hesitation or worry, she just let go. She didn't ask anyone for advice. She didn't read a book on how to let go. She didn't search the scriptures. She just let go. She let go of all of the memories that held her back. She let go of all of the anxiety that kept her from moving forward. She let go of the planning and all of the calculations about how to do it just right. She didn't promise to let go. She didn't journal about it. She didn't write the projected date in her Day-Timer. She made no public announcement and put no ad in the paper. She didn't check the weather report or read her daily horoscope. She just let go. She didn't analyze whether she should let go. She didn't call her friends to discuss the matter. She didn't do a five-step Spiritual Mind Treatment. She didn't call the prayer line. She didn't utter one word. She just let go. No one was around when it happened. There was no applause or congratulations. No one thanked her or praised her. No one noticed a thing. Like a leaf falling from a tree, she just let go. There was no effort. There was no struggle. It wasn't good and it wasn't bad. It was what it was, and it is just that. In the space of letting go, she let it all be. A small smile came over her face. A light breeze blew through her. And the sun and the moon shone forevermore… ~ Safire Rose"
